#Welcome

This project is for Pathfinder Role Playing Game.

We understand that pen and paper RPGs are designed to be use with, well, pen and paper. In order to accommodate this, our character sheet is designed to resemble traditional character sheets as much as possible,with just the right amount of technological assistance.

The objective of this project is create 2 applications, one which serves like a digital character sheet and other which serves to help the master with iniciative tracker, and other things.
